## ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION BEFORE PUBLISHING**

### **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY (Required for Approval)**

#### **1. Screenshots** ❌ **CRITICAL**
```bash
# Status: MISSING - store-assets/screenshots/ is empty

# - WiFi QR generator
# - Batch processing feature
# - Options/settings page
```

#### **2. Console Logs** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**
```bash
# Status: PRESENT in production build
# Issue: 50+ console.log statements in built code
# Action Needed: Run store preparation script
./scripts/prepare-store.sh  # Automatically removes console.logs
```

#### **3. Icon Sizing** ⚠️ **MINOR**
```bash
# Status: Icons exist but may not be perfectly sized
# Current: Copied 32px icon to 16px and 48px slots
# Action Needed: Create properly sized icons or use online tool
# - 16x16px for small displays
# - 48x48px for extension management page  
# - 128x128px for Chrome Web Store listing
```

### **🔍 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Recommended)**

#### **4. Store Promotional Images** ❌
```bash
# Recommended promotional images:
# - Small tile: 440x280px
# - Large tile: 920x680px 
# - Marquee: 1400x560px (for featured placement)
```

#### **5. Privacy Policy URL** ⚠️
```bash
# Current: Privacy policy exists as file
# Needed: Host privacy policy online and add URL to manifest
# Suggestion: Use GitHub Pages or add to your website
```
